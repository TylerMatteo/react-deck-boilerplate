# React Vite Boilerplate

This is a simple React boilerplate created from the Vite `react-ts` [template](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) with Eslint, Prettier, Husky, and lint-staged added on for code quality and pre-commit hooks. It features a bare-bones map powered by Deck.gl using Carto's free basemaps.

# Running the project locally
1. (optional) If you have `nvm` installed, run `nvm use` to switch to Node version specified in `.nvmrc`
2. Install dependencies - `npm i`
3. Run the development server - `npm run dev`
